Implementation strategy

In order to ensure that the user should be able to manage his todo items using 'my todos' application effectively, automated testing is planned to cover a broader set of the functionalities like the following :
1.Adding todo items.
2.Editing todo items.
3.Checking the status of todo items.
4.Multi selection of the todo items.
5.Deleting the todo items.
All the functionalites are covered in the automation script and are implemented using soft assertions.
